# SideBox
A platform for developing and loading some useful tools.Use Java to make plugins(tools) for it such as TimeDisplayer,WeatherForecast or MiniConsolePanel.

# Reasons for development
I found that some information such as weather,emails,github notification...is not convinent to check(I need to open brower and login specific website).  
So I'm developing this platform to make it easier.
This software will become a plugin platform and support plugins developed for specific use.  
All visualization functions will be built using Java Swing.  

## Development Environment
Jetbrains Idea with JDK8
